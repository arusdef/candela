# Candela

Site by Íñigo Lopez and Lukas Eigler-Harding


## to do
- [x] backend forms
	- [x] accounts
- [x] panel install online
- [ ] front end dev
- [x] letsencrypt https


## build
- [ ] candela logo animation

## extra dev
- [ ] magnified image seems wrong
- [ ] image captions size? 
- [ ] contact forms (prefer just a sign-up at most)
- [ ] 3 column seems too much? (i can offer two column images)

## approach

- each section is it's own page (has it's own url)
	- The project
	- Estate specification
	- Architecture
	- Design
	- The ecosystem
	- Amenities
	- Location
	- Investment

- each project has
	- a title
	- whether it's 1/2 or full width
	- files to upload
	- slides
		- text field
		- image field
		- image caption
	- pinned image
	- visible image list

site has sections
- contact
	- title
	- textfield
	- image options
- brochure
	- pdf link (maybe build out w/ pdf.js)
- trailer
	- vimeo link
	- whether to show field
	- whether to have pop up on home page
