## approach

- each section is it's own page (has it's own url)
	- The project
	- Estate specification
	- Architecture
	- Design
	- The ecosystem
	- Amenities
	- Location
	- Investment

- each project has
	- a title
	- whether it's 1/2 or full width
	- files to upload
	- slides
		- text field
		- image field
		- image caption
	- pinned image
	- visible image list

site has sections
- contact
	- title
	- textfield
	- image options
- brochure
	- pdf link (maybe build out w/ pdf.js)
- trailer
	- vimeo link
	- whether to show field
	- whether to have pop up on home page
